If you ask a human to make up 100 random coin flips, 
you’ll probably end up with alternating head-tail results like 
“H T H T H H T H T T,” which looks random (to humans), 
but isn’t mathematically random. 
A human will almost never write down a streak of six heads or six tails in a row, 
even though it is highly likely to happen in truly random coin flips.
